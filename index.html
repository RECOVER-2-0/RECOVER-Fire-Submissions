        <p>Right about here is where I would put the instructions for how to submit a new fire to be included in the RECOVER 2.0 large fire trigger.</p>

        <h1>About RECOVER 2.0</h1>
        <p>Following a wildfire, a comprehensive plan for public safety, burned area stabilization, resource protection, and site recovery needs to be completed within 14 days. 
          This plan becomes the guiding document for managing the activities and budgets for subsequent remediation efforts over the next several years. There are few instances 
          where plans of such wide-ranging scope must be assembled on such short notice and translated into action more quickly.

          In partnership with the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC), Idaho State Universityâ€™s GIS Training and Research Center (GIS TReC) 
          will revise and refine the NASA RECOVER post-wildfire decision support system using cloud-based interactive web mapping capabilities that bring together --in a single 
          application-- the actionable information necessary for use by Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams and land managers. RECOVER 2.0 technologies improve 
          performance, reduce cost, and provide site-specific flexibility for fires across the western United States. The project employs an enhanced large fires trigger (LFT) 
          which automates the creation of data packages in a matter of minutes. These data products are dynamically assembled from a network of authoritative resources and allow 
          access to relevant and current spatial data/reports to significantly improve the decision-making process.</p>
