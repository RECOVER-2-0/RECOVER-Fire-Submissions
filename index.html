        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the NASA RECOVER 2.0 Community Fire Submissions web mapping application. The
          purpose of this application is to allow members of the post-wildfire management and forestry
          communities to submit fires for inclusion in RECOVER. These fires could be new fires that are
          not large enough to be caught by the Large Fire Trigger (which populates the RECOVER_Fires 
          hosted feature layer found in the RECOVER 2.0 dashboard and creates their associated downloadable
          data packages), older fires for which RECOVER data packages were not created, or other fires. 
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          This application works by allowing users to submit fire shapes and additional information.
          Using the Editor widget in the top-right corner of the screen, users can draw new shapes or
          edit existing shapes. After collecting some information including fire name, location, and 
          user contact information, the submitted fire shape is displayed on the map and created in 
          the Community Fire Submissions hosted feature layer. This hosted feature layer is consumed 
          by the Large Fire Trigger on a nightly basis and the submitted fire shape will be made 
          available for download in the RECOVER Dashboard the next morning. Note that adjustments to 
          the submitted fire will overwrite the existing data package.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Locate the area where you plan to submit your fire</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/665c2da036024c9f81f552e16626fbdc/data">
          <p>
            Use the Search widget in the top-left corner to locate an area using Esri's 
            geocoding service. Zoom with the widgets ( + and - ) on the left hand side. 
            Alternatively, click and drag the map to an area of interest and scroll with 
            your mouse or track pad to zoom in or out.
          </p>
          <li>Draw the perimeter of your fire on the map</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/fcc17d455eb747dea7cfc9c258d8c7f1/data">
          <p>
            Click the New Feature button underneath Create features in the Editor widget.
            When activated, the New Feature button will show a blue bar on its left border. 
            This button allows you to click on the map and place vertices. Place vertices 
            until your fire perimeter has been drawn. Double-click on the last vertex to 
            finish drawing your fire perimeter.
          </p>
          <li>Fill out fire information</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e37dfc3a078f4359a13626f5fdbee499/data">
          <p>
            A finished fire perimeter is indicated by the orange and white adjustment box
            around the new shape. You can discard your shape at any time after you finish
            drawing by clicking the back arrow in the top left corner of the Editor widget.
            These squares and circle (called adjustment handles) can be clicked and dragged 
            to adjust the width, height, and rotation of the shape.The editor widget will 
            also switch to the Community Fire Submission Form. Fill out the Fire Information 
            part of the form. Note the Fire Name field is required. The default year is the 
            current year but can be adjusted using the arrows. The Unique ID is automatically 
            generated based on fire name, year, and location. The Location information is 
            automatically generated based on where the fire perimeter is drawn. Automatically 
            generated fields are not editable. 
          </p>
          <li>Fill out submitter information</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/99b98740e11c42f291519e04ea00ef28/data">
          <p>
            This form requires First and Last Name and a valid email address. These fields are
            not displayed in the map. They are used internally in case there are issues
            and the RECOVER team needs to reach out for clarification. Note there is a field 
            that checks validity of the Email Address field. The provided email address *must*
            be valid, otherwise the shape will not be included in RECOVER 2.0. The submitter may
            optionally fill out the Organization field. 
          </p>
          <li>Create new submitted fire feature</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/bfdbeb2aacdc4197af2ecc1834fca10a/data">
          <p>
            Click the blue Create button to finish your submitted fire! The data package 
            will be created the next time RECOVER's Large Fire Trigger runs. Submitted fires 
            will typically be available the day following submission.
