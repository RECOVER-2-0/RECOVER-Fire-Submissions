        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to the NASA RECOVER 2.0 Community Fire Submissions web mapping application. The
          purpose of this application is to allow members of the wildfire and emergency management 
          communities to submit fires for inclusion in RECOVER. These submissions may be fires that were
          not large enough to be acquired by RECOVER's threshold of 1000 acres, or older fires occuring 
          before 2023. 
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
          This app works by allowing users to submit fire polygons and additional information.
          Using the Editor widget in the top-right corner of the screen, users can draw new fire areas or
          edit existing shapes they previously created (Note: edits to a submitted fire will overwrite the 
          existing data package). After collecting some information including fire name, location text, and 
          user contact information, the submitted fire is displayed on the map and added to 
          the Community Fire Submissions feature layer in ArcGIS Online. New fires found in this layer will be 
          processed by RECOVER and made available for download in the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/19af90a8bc5d41188ed855d249bc1c72">
          RECOVER Dashboard</a> by the following day.
        </p>
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <h4>Q: What if I already have a shapefile of a fire I would like to submit?</h4>
        <p>
          A: As long as you have an ArcGIS Online account, you can submit a fire perimeter shape you have 
          previously created with a GIS software. <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/manage-hosted-feature-layers.htm#APPEND">
          Acceptable formats</a> include shapefile (zipped), CSV, Microsoft Excel, file geodatabase (zipped), 
          GeoJSON, and OGC GeoPackage files. Instructions for appending data to the Community Fire Submissions 
          hosted feature layer by uploading an acceptable format can be found <a href="">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Q: Why can't I submit a fire outside of the contiguous western United States? </h4>
        <p>
          A: RECOVER only covers the 11 states in the contiguous western United States (Washington, Oregon, 
          California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming). This app will 
          not accept submissions in other states nor submissions that partially cross into other states or Canada.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Locate the area where you need to submit a new fire</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/665c2da036024c9f81f552e16626fbdc/data">
          <p>
            You may Zoom into the map using the widgets (+ and -) on the left side of the screen 
            or using the mouse wheel and then click and drag the map to an area of interest. 
            Alternatively, you can use the Search widget in the top-left corner to locate an area 
            by name. 
          </p>
          <li>Draw the fire perimeter on the map</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/fcc17d455eb747dea7cfc9c258d8c7f1/data">
          <p>
            Click the New Feature button beneath Create features in the Editor widget.
            When activated, the New Feature button will show a blue bar on its left border. 
            This button allows you to click on the map and place vertices. Place vertices 
            around the fire edge (perimeter) until the fire polygon has been completed. Double-click 
            the last vertex to finish drawing the fire polygon.
          </p>
          <li>Add fire information</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e37dfc3a078f4359a13626f5fdbee499/data">
          <p>
            A finished fire perimeter is indicated by the orange and white adjustment box
            around the new polygon (Note: you can discard your shape at any time after you finish
            drawing by clicking the back arrow in the top left corner of the Editor widget). At this
            time, the editor widget will switch to the Community Fire Submissions Form. Fill out the Fire Information 
            part of the form completely. The default year is the current year but can be adjusted at this time. 
            The Unique ID is automatically generated based on the fire name, year, and general geographic location of the fire polygon. 
            Automatically generated fields such as Unique ID are not editable. 
          </p>
          <li>Add submitter information</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/99b98740e11c42f291519e04ea00ef28/data">
          <p>
            This form requires a First and Last Name as well as a valid email address. These fields are
            not displayed in the map but are used internally in case there are issues
            and the RECOVER team needs to contact you for clarification. The provided email address must
            be valid, otherwise the new fire will not be included in RECOVER 2.0. The submitter may
            optionally complete the Organization field. 
          </p>
          <li>Finalize the new submission</li>
          <img src="https://isu.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/bfdbeb2aacdc4197af2ecc1834fca10a/data">
          <p>
            Click the blue Create button to finish your submission! The data package 
            will be created the next time RECOVER's Large Fire Trigger runs. Submitted fires 
            will typically be available the day following submission.
